# FireGlass Hybrid Cloud Infrastructure Project

## 📌 Overview

This project documents the complete design and deployment of a **hybrid on‑premises + Azure cloud infrastructure** for the company **FireGlass**, transitioning from a fully local environment to a scalable, secure, and cloud‑integrated architecture.

The solution includes:

* On‑premises virtualization with **Proxmox VE**
* Firewall, VPN, IDS/IPS using **OPNsense**
* Local **Active Directory Domain Services**
* DMZ web server with HTTPS and security hardening
* Azure infrastructure with Domain Controller, Entra ID Connect, NSGs, VNETs
* Secure hybrid identity synchronization
* Management client and subnet segmentation

All content is based on the complete technical implementation developed for the ITS INCOM project.

# 🎯 Project Goals

* Migrate FireGlass infrastructure toward a hybrid cloud approach.
* Deploy a modern, secure, scalable environment.
* Implement an **on‑prem AD** and extend it to Azure with a **secondary cloud DC**.
* Deploy an **Entra ID Connect** server for identity synchronization.
* Create a segmented architecture (LAN, DMZ, cloud subnets).
* Implement firewalling, IDS/IPS, VPN, and NSG policies.

# 🏠 On‑Premise Architecture

### **Platform: Proxmox VE**

Used to virtualize:

* Windows Server (ADDS)
* Ubuntu Web Server
* OPNsense Firewall

### **Network Segmentation**

* **LAN:** Internal AD environment
* **DMZ:** Public‑facing web server
* **WAN:** External traffic

### **Key Features**

* VLAN segmentation
* Server isolation
* Resource allocation and snapshots
* Centralized virtualization management

---

# 🔥 Firewall & DMZ Design

### **Firewall: OPNsense**

Configured with:

* WAN/LAN/DMZ separation
* Port forwarding for the public web server
* IPS/IDS using curated rulesets
* VPN tunnel for Azure AD replication
* Geo‑IP analysis for traffic

### **DMZ Web Server**

* Ubuntu Server with Apache2
* HTTPS enforced (certbot + Let’s Encrypt)
* DoS protection: mod_evasive
* Access logging with geolocation
* Firewall rules restricting access to backend systems

---

# 🧩 Active Directory Structure

### **On‑Prem AD Server**

Deployed with:

* Organizational Units:

  * Vendite
  * Acquisti
  * IT
  * ServiziLogistici
* 4 Security Groups (one per OU)
* 16 Users (4 per OU)

### **Hardening Measures**

* Password policies
* Account lockout
* GPO baseline

---

# ☁ Azure Cloud Architecture

### **Infrastructure Includes**

* **Cloud Domain Controller** (replica of on‑prem)
* **Entra ID Connect Server**
* **Management Client VM**
* **Resource Group + VNET + 3 Subnets:**

  * 10.0.0.0/24 → Management
  * 10.0.1.0/24 → Entra ID Sync
  * 10.0.2.0/24 → Cloud DC

### **Networking**

* VPN or S2S connectivity from OPNsense to Azure
* Routing for AD replication
* Private addressing only
* No public exposure except management VM

---

# 🔗 Hybrid Identity & Entra ID Connect

Configured features:

* Password Hash Sync
* Password Writeback
* Hybrid Users synchronization
* Verification of replication between on‑prem and cloud DC

### **Azure Access Control**

* RBAC assigned to IT‑Servizi group
* Least‑privilege roles for maintenance

---

# 🛡 Network Security Groups (NSG)

Rules implemented:

1. Communication only between AD and Entra ID sync server
2. Management Client → RDP to Entra ID server **allowed**
3. Management Client → RDP to AD **blocked**
4. Only Management Client has a public IP
5. No inbound Internet access to cloud servers
6. Segmented East‑West traffic between subnets

---

# 🚨 Incident Response & Security Measures

### **On‑Prem**

* IDS/IPS
* HTTPS enforcement
* SSH hardening
* Firewall rules limiting traffic

### **Cloud**

* NSG micro‑segmentation
* MFA for admin access
* AD Sync monitoring
* Backup and Recovery strategy
